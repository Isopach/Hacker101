Forced Browsing:
https://levels-a.hacker101.com/levels/1/post?id=88
Change post ID to view anyone's post & their gmail IDs

Stored XSS:
Post a HTTP link with a delimiter like " or *
http://test.com/"onload="alert('hakd')
http://requestb.in/*/onmouseover=*alert(1)
  
CSRF:
There's a hidden input for CSRF in the source. Edit that CSRF value to post as someone else.
Todo: Decode the hash of the CSRF; Burp's smart decode returns nothing.
